# Unit-3-PassGen
Password Generator

Here you will find a password generator that will give the user a password with a character length between 8 and 128 characters, along with a choice of which character types you would like to have the password include. 
This program can be used to generate unique and difficult to guess passwords for accounts that you may wish to set up. 

This program was built using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

While using this program, you will immediatly be prompted to decide your password character length, and then which types of characters you would like to have included.

The prompts will give you all the instructions you need. 

Once you have completed the series of prompts you can then click the maroon "Generate Password" button. 
On this click (which was programmed with a click event listener) your password will appear in the text box

the Grey button to the right "Copy to Clipboard" will (you guessed it!) Copy the password to your clipboard for easy application. Paste your password in your various account set ups and you're off and running! 
... Just don't forget your newly generated password!
